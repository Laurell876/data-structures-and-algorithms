# Big O Notation

**Big O Ordered from best to worst:**
1. O(1)
2. O(log n)
3. O(n)
4. O(n log n)
5. O(n^2)
6. O(n!)

**Log n Exlained**

log is a shortened version of log base 2. The log base 2 of a value is basically how many times you can divide that value by 2 before it is equal to or less than 1. For example log base 2 of 8 is 3. This will come up when it's time to evaluate certain searching algorithms.


**Space Complexity**

1. Primitives (booleans, numbers, undefined, null) are constant space
2. Strings require O(n) space, n is the string length. The same applies for arrays.
