# Problem Solving Approaches

Different approaches to try when you have to solve a large or complex problem

**How do you improve**
1. Devise a plan for solving problems
2. Master common problem sovling patterns

Never rush to try to start coding, take some time to start thinking about it first.

## Problem Solving
1. Understand the problem
2. Explore Concrete Examples
3. Break It Down
4. Solve/Simplify
5. Look back and refactor

**Understand the problem**
1. Can you restate the problem in your own words?
2. What are the inputs?
3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
4. Can the outputs be determined by the inputs?
5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

**Explore Concrete Examples**
1. Start with simple examples. State the input and valid output values.
2. Progress with more complex examples.
3. Explore examples with empty or invalid inputs (more useful in the real world and not technical interviews)

**Break It Down**
1. List the different steps that need to be completed and the information to keep in mind for each step

**Solve/Simplify**
Solve the problem if you can, if you can't solve a simpler problem.
Try to ignore the part that is giving you a hard time to solve everything else.
This allows you to progress without being stuck. Do the things that you know how to do.
In simplifying the problem you might get ideas on how to solve the more challenging part.

**Look back and refactor**
This is not really a priority for technical interviews. But in the real world this includes making a solution more efficient and/or readable.
